Join the data from Part 1 with the data from Part 2 to create a new dataframe.
 
Provide a visualization that you used as part of your EDA process. Explain the initial pattern or relationship you discoved through this visualization.
 
Database
Put all your results in an SQLite3 database (remember, SQLite stores its databases as files in your local machine - make sure to create your database in your project's data/ directory!)
 
Look at the data before and after the join to validate your data.
