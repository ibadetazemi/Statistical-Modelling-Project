# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
(I had querried the API and examined the data returned. Then I had chosen a city covered by the CityBikes API and then had retrieve all available bike stations in that city. For each bike station, I had used the API to call the latitude, longitude and number of bikes + I had Parse the JSON object into a Pandas dataframe.)

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
