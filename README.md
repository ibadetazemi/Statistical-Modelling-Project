# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
(I had queried the API and examined the data returned. Then I had chosen a city covered by the CityBikes API and then had retrieved all available bike stations in that city. For each bike station, I had used the API to call the latitude, longitude and number of bikes + I had Parse the JSON object into a Pandas data frame.)

## Process
### (Step 1: Connecting to CityBikes API)
### (Step 2: Connecting to Foursquare and Yelp APIs)
### (Part 3: Joining Data)
### (Part 4: Building a Model)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(If I had more time I would spend more time on going more in-depth with cleaning data.)
